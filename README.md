Title: "The A-Team: 40 Years Later"

Fade in:

INT. A-Team Headquarters - Day

The camera shows a dusty and abandoned warehouse. It has been 40 years since the A-Team disbanded. Suddenly, the doors burst open and in walks Colonel John "Hannibal" Smith, Lt. Templeton "Faceman" Peck, Sergeant Bosco "B.A." Baracus, and Captain H.M. "Howling Mad" Murdock.

Hannibal: "Gentlemen, it's been a long time."

Faceman: "Too long, Hannibal. What brings us all here?"

Hannibal: "I got a call from General Fulbright. He needs our help."

B.A.: "What kind of trouble we getting into this time?"

Hannibal: "The government has been infiltrated by a group of corrupt officials. They're looking to take down Fulbright and anyone else who stands in their way."

Murdock: "Sounds like a job for the A-Team!"

The camera cuts to the team getting into their van, which has been restored to its former glory. The iconic theme song plays as they drive off.

Cut to:

INT. General Fulbright's Office - Day

General Fulbright is surrounded by a group of men in suits. They are arguing about some important documents.

Fulbright: "Gentlemen, the A-Team will be here soon. They'll take care of this situation."

The door suddenly bursts open and in walks the A-Team.

Hannibal: "Sorry we're late. Traffic was a killer."

Faceman: "Looks like you could use some backup."

B.A.: "I pity the fool who messes with General Fulbright."

Murdock: "I'm just here for the ride!"

The A-Team gets to work, using their unique skills to take down the corrupt officials. There are car chases, explosions, and of course, plenty of one-liners.

After a long and intense battle, the A-Team emerges victorious. The corrupt officials are taken down, and General Fulbright thanks the team for their help.

Fulbright: "I couldn't have done it without you. You're still the best in the business."

Hannibal: "That's what we do, General. We make things right."

The A-Team drives off into the sunset, leaving behind a grateful General Fulbright and a world made a little bit safer.
